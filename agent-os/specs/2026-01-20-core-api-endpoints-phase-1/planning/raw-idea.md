**Core API Endpoints for BBQ Competition Server - Phase 1**

Description: This is Phase 1 of the BBQ Competition Server project. Phase 0 (Database Schema & Migrations) has been completed with all 10 TypeORM entities (User, Event, Table, Seat, Category, Criterion, Team, Submission, Score, AuditLog), 9 migrations, and comprehensive tests.

Phase 1 focuses on building the Core API Endpoints layer on top of the existing database schema. This includes REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on all entities, proper request/response DTOs, validation, and error handling.

The project uses:
- NestJS framework
- TypeORM ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- Vitest for testing

The codebase is located at:
- Main source: /Users/johnayers/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Ayers Programming/CBA/server
- Agent-OS docs: /Users/johnayers/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Ayers Programming/CBA/agent-os
